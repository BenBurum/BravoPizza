			Bravo Pizza has been dedicated to providing the best food in Boxborough with great service since 1989.  Nick, Simon, and everyone at Bravo thank you for choosing us, the only place in town =P
			<br /><br />
			Web masters note: I imagine you probably would want a more realistic picture of the restaurant in the final version of the website, but all I could find on the internet was a crappy picture and then I couldn't help myself from playing with the Photoshop filters.  If you choose to use this website I could obviously incorporate a different picture, as well as more personal information about the restaurant, its owners, and their history if you want.  I also think it would be a good idea to include information about the delivery area on the website.  I also would imagine you'd want to take out the line about being the only place in town.
