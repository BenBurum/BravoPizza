# BravoPizza
Website for local pizza delivery restaurant created as final project for Intro DHTML class at Umass Lowell.
The restaurant didn't actually want a website so they never looked at it and most images are taken from their take-out menu without permission.
The "Bravo Pizza" text at the top was designed by me.
